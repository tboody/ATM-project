/*
Program description: For this program it is necessary to create a C program for this software so that bank clients can control their Personal
Identification Number (PIN) on an ATM (ATM).
Any 4-digit number can serve as the PIN. You can assume that the initial assignment of the number was the customer's default PIN: 1234 
When run, this software should be menu-driven and show a straightforward menu. The following options should Â be available in the menu: 

1. Enter PIN and verify correct
2. Change PIN
3. Display the number of times the PIN was entered (i) Successfully (ii)
Incorrectly
4. Exit Program
